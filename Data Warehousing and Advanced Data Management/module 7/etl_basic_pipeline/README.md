# etl_basic_pipeline
Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) pipelines move data from source systems into a warehouse. The extract step gathers raw records, transform cleans or reshapes them, and load writes them to the target store. Simple pipelines often work with CSV files or API responses. This folder illustrates a minimal pipeline that reads a file, filters rows, and writes out the result.
