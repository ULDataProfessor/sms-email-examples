# pokedex_star_schema
The Pokédex contains detailed records of every Pokémon encounter. This subproject models those encounters in a star schema to support analytics. The fact table stores each time a trainer sees or catches a Pokémon, while dimension tables describe Pokémon attributes, trainers, and locations. Joining these tables enables flexible queries about encounters and trainer behavior.
