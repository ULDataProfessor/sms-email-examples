# ml_feature_store_example
Machine learning projects benefit from a managed feature store that serves both training and online prediction. Features extracted from raw sources are stored with versioning so they remain consistent across datasets. This example saves derived features, then loads them into a scikit-learn pipeline. It illustrates the bridge between data engineering and ML workflows.
