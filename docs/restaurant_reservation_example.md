# üçΩÔ∏è Restaurant Reservation Example

This example simulates taking a reservation for a restaurant. When you run `reservation_system.py` it gathers the guest's contact details, emails a confirmation, and sends a reminder text.

## How It Works
1. The script asks for the guest name, phone number, email address, and reservation time.
2. An email confirmation is sent using your SMTP settings.
3. The guest also receives an SMS reminder.

### Reservation Code
```python
email_subject = f"{COMPANY_NAME} Reservation Confirmed"
send_email(email, email_subject, email_body)
send_sms(phone, f"Reminder: reservation at {COMPANY_NAME} on {date} at {time}.")
```

## Environment Variables
After copying `env_example.txt` to `.env`, set the following:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID` | Twilio account SID for sending SMS. |
| `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` | Auth token for the Twilio account. |
| `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER` | Twilio number used to send reminders. |
| `EMAIL_HOST` | SMTP server to send emails. |
| `EMAIL_PORT` | Port number for the SMTP server. |
| `EMAIL_USE_TLS` | Set to `True` if SMTP requires TLS. |
| `EMAIL_USERNAME` | Username or address for SMTP authentication. |
| `EMAIL_PASSWORD` | Password or app password for SMTP. |
| `COMPANY_NAME` | Restaurant name displayed in messages. |
| `COMPANY_EMAIL` | Sender address for the confirmation email. |

## Run It
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python reservation_system.py
```
