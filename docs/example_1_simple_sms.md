# Simple SMS Sender

This page explains the basics of sending a text message with Twilio using [example_1_simple_sms.py](../example_1_simple_sms.py).

```bash
python example_1_simple_sms.py
```

The script loads your Twilio credentials from a `.env` file, prompts for a destination phone number and sends a friendly SMS.
