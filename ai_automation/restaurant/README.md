# 🍽️ Restaurant AI Pipeline Example

This folder contains a small demonstration of how AI concepts can be used in a restaurant setting. The script `pipeline.py` ingests customer reviews from the console, performs a simple keyword‑based sentiment analysis, processes the score into a short summary, and prints the result.

## Running
```bash
python pipeline.py
```
Enter several review lines and press **Enter** on a blank line to finish. The program will output whether the overall sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral.
