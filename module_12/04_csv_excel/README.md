# CSV & Excel Automation

**Objective:**  
Write a script that:
- Reads `sales.csv` into Pandas
- Performs simple aggregation (total, average per region)
- Exports the result to `summary.xlsx` with two worksheets: “raw” and “summary”

**Codex Prompt:**  
“Create a Python script using Pandas that reads `sales.csv`, computes total and average sales by region, then writes both the original data and the aggregated summary into `summary.xlsx`, each on its own sheet.”
