# File Organization Automation

**Objective:**  
Create a Python script that:
- Scans a source directory for files by extension (e.g. `.txt`, `.jpg`, `.pdf`)
- Creates subfolders (`text/`, `images/`, `pdfs/`) if they don’t exist
- Moves each file into its appropriate folder

**Codex Prompt:**  
“Generate a Python script using `pathlib` that organizes all files in `~/Downloads` into subdirectories based on file extension (e.g. text/, images/, pdfs/). Ensure it creates the target folders if missing and logs each move to the console.”
