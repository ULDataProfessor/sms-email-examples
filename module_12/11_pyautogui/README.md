# GUI Automation with PyAutoGUI

## Project Overview
`pyautogui_example.py` showcases basic automation tasks using the PyAutoGUI library. The script moves the mouse, types text and captures a screenshot, demonstrating how to control the keyboard and mouse programmatically.

## Variables
The example uses hard coded screen coordinates for simplicity. Adjust the `moveTo` calls in the script if your screen resolution differs or you want to interact with other locations.

## Instructions
Install PyAutoGUI with `pip install pyautogui` and run `python pyautogui_example.py`. Switch to the application you want to automate before the 5â€‘second countdown finishes.

## Explanation
PyAutoGUI offers functions to control the mouse and keyboard. This example moves the cursor, performs clicks, types a short message and saves a screenshot to `screenshot.png`. The approach can be extended to automate repetitive GUI tasks.
